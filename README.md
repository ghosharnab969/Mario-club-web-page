# mario-club-web-page (learning Front-end)
In this webpage I have worked on the following concepts of front-end using HTML5 and CSS:
  => used the properties of semantic markup, code is properly classified into <header>, <main>, <nav> etc.
  => used pseudo classes to give effects while hovering specific links.
  => used media queries to make the web page responsive for all devices irrespective of screen size.
  => utilized the basic concepts of "position : relative, absolute, sticky etc." to make the interface look good.
  => used sober colors that won't irritate the user vision and hence increase the overall user experience.
